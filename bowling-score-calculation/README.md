This was a simple pair-programming and test-driven development exercise. The exercise involved calculating bowling scores. Though it did not go into absolute detail (like 10th frame strike calculations). It was a nice little test.

The actual test used a test suite library, but I ended up rolling my own in this re-write because frankly it took less time than downloading an npm library and the whole point was just to get the tests to work ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The included tests are as close as I could get from memory to the ones listed in the exercise description.
